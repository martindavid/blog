I'm a Christian, Father to my beloved son, software engineer and crypto enthusiast in my spare time. I'm a senior software engineer at [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/) where I'm having fun build a product to help employee around the world to be more engage with their company. I decided to start building my own blog because I always encounter many similar problems that I already forgot what the solution is.

I'm interested in technology, gadgets, web technology (web2 / web3) - I believe the web is the future, startup and everything about personal development.

Aside from technology, I also into a healthy lifestyle. I recently start powerlifting program (even though I'm not planning to compete in any meet (Yet!)), explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and read a lot of books.

That's me. If you like my blog and project, please [subscribe](/feed.xml) to my blog and stare at my project on [Github](https://github.com/martindavid).

Cheers,
Martin
