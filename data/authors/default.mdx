I'm a software engineer, iron lifter and crypto enthusiast in my spare time. I currently work as a senior software engineer at [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/) where I'm having fun build a product to improve employee experience around the world. I decided to start building my own blog because I always encounter many of the similar problems that I already forgot what the solution is.

I'm interested in technology, gadgets, web technology (web2), web3 and blockchain - I believe the web is the future. I write all things about web development, programming, startup and some time personal development.

Aside from technology, I also into a healthy lifestyle. I do powerlifting lightly (even though I'm not planning to compete in any meet), explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and read a lot of books.

That's me. If you like my blog and project, please [subscribe](/feed.xml) to my blog and stare at my project on [Github](https://github.com/martindavid).

Cheers,

Martin
