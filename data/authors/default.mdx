I'm a software engineer, iron lifter, and crypto enthusiast in my spare time. I currently work as a senior frontend engineer at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a>, where I collaborate with a group of great minds to build a CSM AI Agent product that helps companies with their customer service management. I decided to start building my own blog because I often encounter similar problems and tend to forget the solutions.

I'm interested in technology, gadgets, web technology (Web2), Web3, and blockchainâ€”I believe the web is the future. I write about all things related to web development, programming, startups, and sometimes personal development.

Aside from technology, I also embrace a healthy lifestyle. I do powerlifting lightly (even though I'm not planning to compete in any meets), explore the beautiful city of Melbourne, and read a lot of books. I also love to help others break into tech; if you're keen to chat about it, please feel free to connect with me through <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/martin-valentino" target="_blank">ADPList</a>, and I'd be happy to chat.

That's me! If you like my blog and projects, please [subscribe](/feed.xml) or check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/martindavid" target="_blank">Github</a>.

Cheers,

Martin
