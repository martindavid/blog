## Lesson Notes

## `useReducer`: Simple Counter

The course start with a brief comparison on `useState` and `useReducer` and how you can use one to replace another. Kent’s [blogpost](<[https://kentcdodds.com/blog/should-i-usestate-or-usereducer](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/should-i-usestate-or-usereducer)>) explain the trade-offs between two and use case for each.

- TLDR; from the blogpost
  - **When it's just an independent element of state you're managing: `useState`**
  - **When one element of your state relies on the value of another element of your state in order to update: `useReducer`**
  - starting with **`useState`** , and moving to **`useReducer`**when you notice elements of state need to change together.
- My take: if you’re familiar with redux, the pattern in `useReducer` kind of similar, where you write reducer function that consists of state and action.
- `useReducer` will return an array where first index is the state and second index is the dispatcher function
- Reducer function → `func(state, action)`
  - The structure that you most likely see, which `newState` may includes an `action` is a convention for the reducer function and not an actual API from `useReducer`
  - The second argument for the reducer function is the value that the dispatcher function arguments receive
- We can also simulate the dispatcher function to accept a function with the argument is the previous state, similar to the dispatcher function in `useState`.

  - By constructing the reducer function like this

  ```tsx
  const countReducer = (state, action) => {
    return {
      ...state,
      ...(typeof action === 'function' ? action(state) : action),
    }
  }
  ```

  The `useReducer` dispatch function now can be called with

  - `dispatch(newValue)` or
  - `dispatch((prevState) => { ...prevState, newValue })`

## `useCallback`: custom hooks

- It’s a hook that’s used for memoization. In react you can use `useCallback` or `useMemo` for memoization. Kent’s has a good article discuss about this in detail
  - [https://epicreact.dev/memoization-and-react/](https://epicreact.dev/memoization-and-react/)
  - [https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback)
- In this section, I learn to refactor a logic within a component to be a custom hook. In the exercise, it’s to refactor the API call function that previously run within a component to a custom hook.
  - In this exercise, Kent put a reminder on how important to list out the dependencies array for the `useCallback` hook or otherwise potentially we’ll get the indefinite re-render or unexpected re-render.
- The exercise in this section teach me how various kind of use case where the `useCallback` can be suitable to use, especially at the custom hook level.

  - The exercise also teach a simple trick to make sure `dispatch` function in `useReducer` can be called safely, for a case there’s a long operation happening at the dispatch and the component has an unexpected unmount. This require us to use `useRef` to determine the mount/unmount state. Code below for reference

  ```tsx
  function useSafeDispatch(dispatch) {
    const mountedRef = React.useRef(false)

    React.useEffect(() => {
      mountedRef.current = true
      return () => {
        mountedRef.current = false
      }
    }, [])

    return React.useCallback(
      (...args) => (mountedRef.current ? dispatch(...args) : void 0),
      [dispatch]
    )
  }
  ```

I’d say I spent some time in this section to fully understand the pattern here, and still try to think how can I apply this in my work.

## `useContext`: simple Counter

This section of the course gives a brief intro to the React context and how we can

This section also revisit some of the concepts like:

- Lifting state up - [https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
- Props drilling - [https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling)
- He mention that lot of people said that context is used to avoid having a props drilling “issue”, it’s not the only solution. Composition probably a way better solution for solving props drilling than rely on react context. This is a reference video to learn more about it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XaXKiXtNjw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XaXKiXtNjw)

<YoutubeEmbed id="3XaXKiXtNjw" />

- He will touch more on this composition pattern later in the Advanced React Pattern course

This section also teach about how to wrap a context into a custom hook that can be easily shared to a consumer.

This section also teach me one trick that I end up use in the Goal Tree. Have a context initialise with just undefined (because the initial value is undetermined initially)

```tsx
import React from 'react'

interface GoalTreeState {
  expandedNodes: string[]
  updateExpandedNodes: (newExpandedNodes: string[]) => void
}

const GoalTreeStateContext = React.createContext<GoalTreeState | undefined>(undefined)

interface GoalTreeStateProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export function GoalTreeStateProvider({ children }: GoalTreeStateProps) {
  const [expandedNodes, setExpandedNodes] = React.useState<string[]>([])

  const updateExpandedNodes = (newExpandedNodes: string[]) => {
    setExpandedNodes(newExpandedNodes)
  }

  return (
    <GoalTreeStateContext.Provider value={{ expandedNodes, updateExpandedNodes }}>
      {children}
    </GoalTreeStateContext.Provider>
  )
}

export function useGoalTreeState() {
  const context = React.useContext(GoalTreeStateContext)

  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useGoalTreeState must be used within GoalTreeStateProvider')
  }

  return context
}
```

Another examples in this section is to use React context to cache the response from API call.

## `useLayoutEffect`: auto-growing textarea

- Read Kent’s article on the comparison for `useEffect` vs `useLayoutEffect` [https://kentcdodds.com/blog/useeffect-vs-uselayouteffect](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/useeffect-vs-uselayouteffect)
  - TLDR;
    - Use **`useLayoutEffect`** when there’s a need to mutate the DOM or do measurement to the actual DOM that’s rendered to the browser
    - Use **`useEffect` for any other side-effect that’s not required mutating the DOM or getting measurement from the DOM element.**
- Simple rule from the course
  If you are making observable changes to the DOM, then it should happen in `useLayoutEffect`, otherwise `useEffect`.
- This section doesn’t give much explanation as it should be obvious enough on the use case for this particular hook.

## `useImperativeHandle`: scroll to top/bottom

This is react hook that allows us to expose imperative methods to a component consumer which pass a ref prop to our component and it needs to be handled imperatively.

- The exercise from this section teach about how to attach a function to a `ref` object and call it from the component consumer.

I will never know about this hook if it’s not from this course. Kent also said, there’s a little use case for this hook for a problem that you probably can solve with React native “declarative” way.

## `useDebugValue`

It’s a react hook that is useful in conjunction with React Devtools. It can only be used inside a custom hook.

This hook basically allow you to give a label to a custom hook so that it gives more context for debugging in the React dev tools

- Without `useDebugValue`

- With `useDebugValue`

![with useDebugValue](https://res.cloudinary.com/martin-labs/image/upload/v1670494652/Blog/with-usedebugvalue.png)

Basically it’s like put a `console.log`, but you can see the print out directly from the React Dev Tools
