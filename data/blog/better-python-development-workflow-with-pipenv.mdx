summary: In my previous post, I have briefly describe my current python development workflow using a combination of `virtualenv`, `pyenv`, and `pyenv-virtualenv`. It's been great for me and serve my workflow very well. But recently, my colleague at work, introduce me with a package call [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I look into the website and, it seems promising in terms of makes my workflow more convenient.

In my previous post, I have briefly describe my current python development workflow using a combination of `virtualenv`, `pyenv`, and `pyenv-virtualenv`. It's been great for me and serve my workflow very well. But recently, my colleague at work, introduce me with a package call [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I look into the website and, it seems promising in terms of makes my workflow more convenient.

As per its website says, the problem that pipenv trying to solve is [1]:

- You no longer need to use pip and virtualenv separately. They work together.
- Managing a requirements.txt file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.
- Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.
- Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks arising from outdated components.
- Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. \$ pipenv graph).
- Streamline development workflow by loading .env files.

This post is basically an updated version from my previous one. In this post I will describe the process to integrate pipenv into your python development workflow, and hopefully can make you more productive with it.
I assume you have `pyenv` and version of python installed in your machine. (I suggests to install python from pyenv, because it can save you with any issue related to priviledge access).

# Install pipenv

Installing pipenv is pretty straightforward (:fingercross).

```
$ pip install pipenv
```

Even though at their website, for OSX they using homebrew, I found out that it can't find python installation from `pyenv` and it tried to install python again. The other thing that I found is, when you install pipenv, it will also install `virtualenv` for you.

# Use pipenv for your package management

## New Project

If you start with clean project `pipenv` usage will be straight forward. For example, let say you want to create a new
django project.

```
$ mkdir YourAwesomeProject
$ cd YourAwesomeProject
$ pipenv install django
```

When you run above command on terminal:

- pipenv first will create virtualenv with name convention `YourAwesomeProject-<random string>`
- Create `Pipfile` for the project
- install django package and generate `Pipfile.lock`

You'll most likely see a result like below:

```

To activate this project's virtualenv, run pipenv shell.
Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.
```

If you look at `Pipfile`, you'll see something like below:

```
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
Django = "*"

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
```

That `*` version in Django package will make sure that you use the latest version. Pipenv will make sure that it will always compatible with all of packages associated with Django

## Existing Project

If you have a python project that previously using `requirements.txt`, pipenv also provide an easy way to migrate from it.
You only need to run this command: `pipenv install -r requirements.txt`.
The command above, will read `requirements.txt` file and generate `Pipfile` with `Pipfile.lock`.

If you look at your `Pipfile`, you'll see something like this.

```
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
Django = "==2.1.3"

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
```

That version of django will similar to the one you have in `requirements.txt` file. I recommend to change it to `*`, so it will always get the latest one and let pipenv handle all of the dependencies.

### Install package only for development

Without `pipenv`, I usually have several `requirements.txt` file to differentiate between development and production environment. I usually have:

```
- common.txt            # all of package that is common on dev and prod
- requirements.txt      # common package + package only for production
- requirements-dev.txt  # common package + package only for development
```

With `pipenv` I can easily install package that only exist for development and everything still manageable with `Pipfile`. Let say I want to have `pytest` for running my unittest.

```
$ pipenv install pytest --dev
```

That command line argument `--dev` above will install `pytest` package only when you specify that argument.

## Pipenv for development

After you setup your project for pipenv, the next thing is easy.

```
$ pipenv shell # activate the virtualenv
$ exit # if you have finished and want to exit virtualenv
```

# Conclusion

That's all then. I have been used it for a couple of months and it's improve the way I manage my python project package since then.
