With the recent #Spectre/#Meltdown event I decided to do a clean install to my early 2015 13" macbook pro. I have a couple of times did clean install for my laptop, it's interesting because you can always have a new initial setup for every clean install that you did. In this post, my initial setup for new macbook or a macbook with a clean os installation.

# Do this first!

One of the reasons I upgrade my osx to the new one is because of the recent security issue called Spectre/Meltdown. Having that in mind, with this new installation the first thing that I did is to make sure that my mac has all of the security feature turn on. But before that, make sure you have run the Software Update to ensure that the operating system is at the latest point release.

## My Security Checklist

#### Turn Firewall On

Select System Preferences => Security & Privacy, and set the following:

- Under General, set require a password after sleep or screen saver begins to immediately
- Click Advancedâ€¦ and select Require an administrator password to access system-wide preferences
- Under Firewall, click Turn Firewall On.

#### Enable File Vault

File Vault is a security protection against anyone with physical access to your computer. All other security measures will be completely bypassed if someone with physical access simply restarts the computer with a bootable pen drive. It's a completely secure feature, so you have to make sure you remember your password and the recovery key, otherwise you can permanently lose access to your data if you lose both.

#### Set a firmware password

It's another layer of protection to make sure no one can access the **Recovery** mode without password. For more details about how to turn on the firmware password you can follow the guideline here https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204455

## My Mac Default Config

From System Preferences:

- Trackpad => Tap to click

  - Make it to the left
