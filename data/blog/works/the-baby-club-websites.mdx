This is a website I build for a startup that I co-found with my friend. This is a fully functional E-Commerce website with feature:

- Product Builder to dynamically design your own stroller
- CMS to administer content on the website
- Checkout page integrate with Stripe to accept payment

Unfortunately, we are no longer functional, after almost a year bootstraping and try to get our product to the market.

## Technology Stack

- Python/Django
- PostgreSQL
- React/Flux
- Bootstrap CSS
- Stripe API

## Infrastructure

- AWS ElasticBeanstalk
- AWS Cloudfront
- AWS RDS
- Mailchimp
