summary: Last week, I attended the Web Directions Code conference. It's a two days conference that covers various different topics around web development. The theme for this year conference was (as I quote from their website) "front of the front end" and the "back of the front end" –the technologies (JavaScript, the React ecosystem, CSS, browser APIs), and practices (privacy, security, performance, platform engineering and operations, and more) that underpin today's web sites and app. In this post, I'd like to share some notes from the talks that I attended and the learning I have from that.

# Day 1

## Keynote - Beyond the Web of today

**Speaker**: Kenneth Rohde Christiansen -  Intel Corporation - Principal Engineer and Web Platform Architect

### Summary

At Intel, we work at the forefront of innovation as our hardware roadmaps are defined years ahead of release. This means that we need to make sure that the web platform takes advantage of new hardware capabilities as they are released or shortly after. This ranges from enabling new form factors to taking advantage of hardware accelerators.

In this talk we will discuss some of the innovations that Intel is bringing to the web, such as WebNN, which enables access to fast neural network and machine learning capabilities; Web GPU and Compute Pressure, a new API enabling better user experience and bringing adaptive compute capabilities to the client, just like adaptive streaming has improved streaming use-cases by adapting to live network conditions.

<Collapsible title="Notes">
    - Intel bet on Cross-platform apps. development
    - Web is on the right path to be the building blocks for cross-platform application
        - Web as Application Development Platform
        - Focus on the performance of the app with
            - WebAssembly
            - MediaPipe
            - Native support for machine learning (WebNN?)
        - Intel build the tech for the web that’s supported by the hardware that they currently build and optimise.

    - Developer bet on the web technology
        - Web technology requires interoperability - browsers
        - Mention Progressive Web Apps that dominate the application open on the browser on the PC
        - [Project Fugu](https://developer.chrome.com/capabilities/)
          Project Fugu is an effort to close gaps in the web's capabilities enabling new classes of applications to run on the web.
            - Example: [vscode.dev](http://vscode.dev) can access local filesystem with the FileSystem Access API
        - [Origin Private File Systems](https://web.dev/origin-private-file-system/)
          The origin private file system allows web apps to store and manipulate files in their very own origin-specific virtual filesystem, including low-level file manipulation, byte-by-byte access, and file streaming. The origin private file system is supported across all major browsers.

    - Safety and Privacy on the Web-native app
        - How does the web native app take care of user privacy and safety for the user?
            - App signing, action approval

    - Web API that supports performance
        - [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
        - [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
        - [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API)
        - Web Neural Network?
        - WebCodec → Accelerating media processing - The work between Intel and Google has been used by Zoom to accelerate the video conference call

    WebGPU
    The WebGPU API enables web developers to use the underlying system's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to carry out high-performance computations and draw complex images that can be rendered in the browser.

    - Intel has been involved from the beginning to create the spec for WebGPU
        - Example:
            - babylon.js
            - Unreal engine
            - Unity
    - WebGPU allow us to run compute-process on the web.
    - Intel is the owner of the WebGPU backend for tensorflow.js
        - Work collaboratively with Google to improve the performance at this end

    - AI at Scale Web Neural Network API
        - a [web api](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webnn-intro/) that’s build within the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/)
        - In this talk, the speaker also showcased the performance example on how the use of WebNN can improve the performance of background replacement flow compared to purely on WASM
        - a low-level ML API that’s built specifically to support the use case of ML/AI in the web platform
        - Features that the dev. need in terms of:
            - Background blurry
                - It’s already implemented as part of WebRTC API
            - Face Detection
                - OpenCV, Mediapipe, ShapeDetection, WebRTC (nowadays)

    - Intel focus on bringing telemetry for measuring User Experience with [Compute Pressure API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/compute-pressure/)
      - The Compute Pressure API offers high-level states that represent the pressure on the system. It allows the implementation to use the right underlying hardware metrics to ensure that users can take advantage of all the processing power available to them as long as the system is not under unmanageable stress.
      - Release the API under developer.chrome

## 2. Perceived Performance

**Speaker**: Luke Denton - Principal Frontend Software Engineer - Aligent

### Summary
What is perceived performance? It can’t be measured, it’s a perception, it’s a feeling of performance. In the context of a website, perception is reality.

If a website feels fast to a user, then it is fast. In this talk, we’re going to explore some patterns and techniques that we use in our day-to-day, working on large-scale e-commerce websites, ensuring our client’s customers have the best experience possible, which leads to happier customers and higher conversions.

<Collapsible title="Notes">
    What is performance

    - Is it the lighthouse score??
    - Is it time on site?
    - Is it website conversion?

    What is perceived performance?

    - Subjective feeling that the website is instant to load

    Perceived performance patterns

    1. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
        - Layout Jank
        - Overcome it with skeleton loaders
            - Or push the element that’s distracted to the bottom

    2. Loading Indicators
        - Show exactly when a user is being made to wait
    3. Local Data Cache
        - Remember what the user has already seen and not re-fetching the data that the user has already seen
        - swr pattern - Use react-query
        - The speaker shows a demo to build a vanilla JS SWR Implementation
        - how to persist the data
            - localStorage and sessionStorage
            - IndexedDB
            - CacheAPI
    4. Prefetching
        - Prefetch focus on data/text elements like data requests or JS/CSS
        - When to pre-fetch
            - Immediately
            - When the network is idle
            - Based on the viewport
        - Downsides
            - Increases bandwidth - we can mitigate by tracking what’s cached

    5. Browser Cache
        - Leverage browser cache for the image that’s already been loaded
        - Downsides
            - Resolution mismatch
    6. Optimistically update the UI

## 3. Code Evolution at Scale

**Speaker**: Jake Lane - Senior Software Engineer - Atlassian

### Summary

When you first start building a web application, it's easy to write code and pull in the dependencies you need. What happens in 5 years (or 5 weeks) when the industry has decided what once was a super useful library is causing enterprise computers to become fire hazards?

In this talk, we'll cover how we can modernise our code to the new dependencies we want, build tools and processes to migrate to new code, and avoid breaking things without moving too slowly.

<Collapsible title="Notes">
    - Question:
        - How do we migrate commonly used code to something new?

    Below are some of the strategies and factors to consider when working to improve the legacy codebase

    #### Manual migration

    - Heavy reliance on the validation tools (types, test)
    - Pros
        - Easy to do
        - Fast to start
        - Very slow and risky

    #### Enforcing code standards
    - Use tooling to direct people towards the standard that we want
    - use eslint
        - eslint-plugin-you-dont-need-momentjs
    - use types (flow or typescript)
        - It’s very impactful to improve the type coverage
    - [Ratcheting](https://robertgreiner.com/continuous-code-improvement-using-ratcheting/)
        - Do not allow any new usages of a pattern
        - The usage count can only go down or stay the same
    - Transforms / Codemods
        - Change code from one state to another
        - jscodeshifts
        - uses AST as the data structure
            - [AST Explorer website](https://astexplorer.net/)
        - Pros:
            - Pretty easy
            - Flexible
            - Repeatable
                - Easy to rerun
                - Merge conflicts don’t matter
                - Can be made as a part of dev. tooling
    - Simple manual search and replace with regex

    #### Risk Appetite

    Risk of tests missing errors
    - How confident in our test suite
        - Confidence in visual changes
        - Confident in functional changes

    Risk impact on customers
    - Time to recovery
    - Blast radius
    - Measurement - are we introducing performance regression
    - Can be reduced by
        - Feature flagging
        - Rollback strategies
            - Have a runbook

    Risk of incorrect changes
    - Can be overcome by manual testing

    Speed up the migration for legacy code
    
    An approach that the speaker has taken for large changes to the legacy codebases:

    - Make changes in multiple batches
        - Each change should be trivial
    - The first pass should be the largest but the least complex
    - The last pass should be the most complex but should be quite small
    - Scope out to the next batch if we encounter complexity in the middle

    - Avoid Scope Creep
        - Try not to change things unrelated to your goal
        - Drop it and come back later if something taking up a lot of our times

    - Tools that make large changes easier
        - Custom git merge driver (e.g. run a codemod on merge conflicts)
        - PR generation tool
        - Codemod CLI

## 4. Incident Management - Talk the Talk, Walk the Walk

**Speaker**: Hila Fish - Senior DevOps Engineer - Wix

### Summary
Incident management can be challenging and throw you curveballs with unexpected issues, resulting in data loss, downtimes, and overall money & hours of sleep going to waste, BUT! There are practical things you could do to make it a smoother process and handle it better.

Remember when we were at school, and people said - "Actively listening in class guarantees 50% prep for the upcoming test"? The same goes for being proactive at work in ways that will instantly prepare you to manage incidents better (at night or in general).

In this talk, I'll cover the proactive ways you could take and incorporate into your day-to-day routine, to prepare you for a smoother and more efficient incident management process.

I will also show the best practices I've finalized over the years that helped me get a clear vision of how to manage production incidents in the quickest & efficient way possible. Embracing the tips I'll give you will guarantee you'll not only talk the talk but also walk the walk when it comes to incident management.

<Collapsible title="Notes">
- Not all pages become an incident

The mindset - Don’t think only about your systems, also understand the WHY????

- Business mindset is required to grasp the overall impact of the incident on the business
- Important mindset to put - Everything fail all of the time - quotes by Werner Vogels

Incident management structure reference by OnPage

1. Identify the incident / categorise

Question to ask

- Do I understand the full extent of the problem and business impact
- Can this wait and be handled during business hours?
- Was I notified about this from the proper / expected channel

1. Notify and escalate
    - Who should be notified about the incident
    - Does this incident needs escalation?
        - Do I need other stakeholders to involve in the incident or not

1. Investigate and diagnose
    - What info is relevant towards incident resolution
    - Has the root cause been identified? Do we understand the cause of the root cause?
        - Prioritise the root cause over symptoms of the issue

1. Resolve and recovery
    - Do the fastest solution to eliminating downtime without compromising the system’s health and stability
    - Is there any action items needed after resolving the issue
        - Preventing a recurring issue is the priority
2. Closure
    - Be an end-to-end communicator. Communicate with the stakeholder that’s involved or needs to know that the incident has been resolved.
    - Is the incident runbook still relevant or needs to be updated after the incident has been resolved following the existing runbook

Quality for incident manager

- Impromptu action taker
    - Brainstorming the solution
- Can operate under pressure
- Work methodically
- Able to ask for help - it is always important to resolve the issue and align with the impact that it will cause on the business
- Sense of ownership and initiative - Monitor post-incident to make sure that the issue does not continue to become the problem
- Good communicator

Some tips from the speaker on how can we be more proactive after the incident happens:
- During the on-call shifts handoffs
  - Celebrate the team's success in resolving the issue
- Post-mortem notes - create PIR immediately
- Create an action to stabilize the environment that causing the incident
- Adjust the alert - fix the `false positive` alert - don't wait for the next on-call to do it
- Update the incident runbooks if needs to be
- See if there are parts that can be automated - candidates for self-remediation
- Once the issue is handled - share the knowledge with a broader engineering team

## 5. Hacked

**Speakers**: James Cave & Chris Lienert - Principal Consultants - Cognizant Servian

### Summary
If you go by media releases, security breaches don't happen that often. In practice, there are many incidents that no one ever hears about and sooner or later it's going to happen to you.

What happens when you get hacked? We'll go through different scenarios and discuss what you can do about it.

<Collapsible title="Notes">
- First problem - committing a secret key to the public GitHub repo
  - This reminds me of the same incident that affected me during my uni. time. It wasn't as much as the speakers
    demonstrate (Mine was around $4k within 80hrs), but it has shown how this small mistake can cost you money.
    Fortunately, AWS waive that cost within my account as I begged for mercy as I'm only a student at that time.

- Security policy is there for a reason, don’t look for a way to sideway the security policy

If you leave something vulnerable, you’ll get hacked.

How to mitigate the security issue

- Learn about how to mitigate the risk of the security
- Questioning about every security policy in place

Do something that makes us better at what we’re doing in a secure way

Overall, the talk is presented theatrically and engaging to showcase several scenarios where we can get hacked
in the real world

## 6. Attacking the front-end: Modern-day client-side security

**Speaker**: Kaif Hasan - Product Security Engineer - Atlassian

## Summary
We’ve come a long way since the early days of client-side security when injection attacks like XSS and SQLi were rampant. Modern frameworks come with a lot of out-of-the-box protections. But with the frameworks, the attackers have also evolved. In this talk, Kaif Ahsan, a Product Security Engineer at Atlassian, will share the most common ways modern web applications are hacked. Many of which he regularly comes across at work.

We will various techniques and examples of exploiting modern web applications like React, and Angular. Through practical examples, code samples and much the developers will understand how the attacks happen and their impact. Furthermore, we will be exploring various best practices to tackle these vulnerabilities and build secure web apps.

<Collapsible title="Notes">
Common dangerous security issues

- Code Injection Attacks
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Context-sensitive output encoding is the best way to prevent XSS
    - XSS in React
        - Improper sanitisation while outputting html - the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
            - Can be solved by using the 3rd party library to sanitise the HTML output for these props
        - React escape hatch - a way to react to direct DOM manipulation
        - URLs, CSS, and Markdown all can be used to run malicious code
            - Avoid taking URL as an input
            - Do URLs sanitisation
        - Look for React Vulnerable / React Suspended
    - Angular do better input sanitisation than React
    - Angular XSS Attach Vector
        - Template Injection Attack - is existed in version 1.6
        - Solution
            - Stick to Angular default ways
- Use CSRF Tokens as a security measure against requests from the UI 
    - Some strategies Atlassian has taken
      - State-changing operations must not use GET requests, as CSRF tokens cannot protect these.
      - Session cookies should have the Samesite attribute set to Strict when possible.
      - All state-changing requests must transmit a valid CSRF token for the request to be accepted.
      - API gateway with a CORS whitelist. Layered defence.

## Closing keynote - Don't believe the hype!

**Speaker**: Dave Berner - Kinde

### Summary
We’ve all been guilty of it, a new technology comes along and you’re desperate to try it out. Before you know it, you’ve installed a bunch of dependencies, completed a brilliant “refactor” and shipped to prod. What you didn’t realise through all the high-fives and back-slapping with your team, is you’ve inadvertently shipped an extra 10mb of JS to the end user!

It’s not a new term but Hype Driven Development is more prevalent in the JavaScript ecosystem than ever. By the end of this talk you’ll see we may not need JavaScript for all the things and sometimes boring can be better…

### Notes
The closing keynote for the first-day conference more into stories of the journey the speaker has gone through from
multiple iterations in Web development techniques and how he emphasises the importance of sticking to the fundamentals
instead of following the hype.


# Day 2

## Keynote - Frontend Platform Engineering

**Speaker**: Serg Hospodarets - Executive VP Global Engineering - Finalsite

### Summary
We are switching from the era of Front-End DevOps to Platform Engineering- to create a company-specific platform to develop and deliver their products.

It goes through the stages of a Design System creation, integrated with a UI Framework (React, Vue, Angular…), and building an abstraction level on top of Cloud providers (AWS, Azure etc.) and tooling (K8S, Terraform..), and CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, Github) + observability and security enablement, to move the cognitive load from the product delivery teams.

Picking the right tooling, and fostering the culture, solution and approaches is complex, but there is a common set of patterns and tools, so this talk is to describe both the reasons why Platform Engineering is a must and to demo which tools and approaches will help you in this journey.

<Collapsible title="Notes">
Problem to solve 

- Acquired different companies (3) with diff. tech. stack and UX/UI solutions
    - Different external services consumed by these diffs. companies and we need to reduce the cost of it
    - 3 days to roll out security fixes
    - PROD deployment only once a month

Frontend-Platform

- Docusaurs (first step - minimum effort)
    - Documentation for all parts of engineering stakeholder
- Engineering portal (backstage)

Tooling for demo

- Use storybook

Stage of frontend-platform

- Childhood stage
    - Build the library on top of the unstyled or headless libraries such as Radix or DaisyUI
        - Adapt with the use of AI tools (example in Warp AI)
    - Build a template generator to speed up the creation of new applications for a different team
        - How to implement this for `next-template`??
    - Utilise AI to drive the documentation effort
        - Example use markprompt.com
- Adolescence stage
    - There’s a tool from Atlassian / Salesforce that works like Linter for design token change
    - Tooling upgradability
        - Provide non-breaking additive changes and LTS versions drop timeline
        - Use codeshift/codemod for frontend code transformer
        - Use renovate for dependencies upgrade
        - Microservices, apps, and infra use JHipster

- Resources for platform engineering https://github.com/shospodarets/awesome-platform-engineering

Opinion from the speaker

- Treat the platform as a product
    - Internal team are your customers, provide support, etc
    - Invest in Platform PM and DevX culture
    - Evangelise - regular releases, demos, newsletters
- Prefer golden path over the golden cage
- Foster the Pull vs Push culture

Tracking customer traction by using backstage as a platform team 

- Use backstage tech. radar to measure the adoption of the components

## 1. Taking advantage of AI to help you write code

**Speaker**: Lachlan Hunt - Senior Developer - Atlassian

### Summary
In this session, we'll explore how AI tools can help developers write better code. We'll cover various ways in which these tools can be used to generate code, improve skills, and debug errors. We'll also discuss their benefits, including time-saving and overall improvement of coding abilities. Moreover, we'll examine their limitations and provide tips on using them effectively. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this session will offer valuable insights into how AI can assist you in writing better code and honing your coding skills.

### Notes
In this talk, the speaker mostly talked about his experience using generative AI tools and AI coding assistants as a
part of the development workflow. He showcases an example of using AI tools to build a calculator application. In his
demo, he wasn't just showing how he use AI tools to help build out the pieces for the Calculator, but also
understanding the concept around the algorithm that's in the app itself.

Overall, there's nothing new in this talk for me, but it is always good to see how other people utilise this
AI tools in their development workflow.

## 2. Falling off the Edge: Practical Uses for Edge Computing

**Speaker**: Alexander Karan - CTO - ClimateClever

### Summary

Unlock the full potential of edge computing with this session. We'll dive deep into what edge computing is, how it works, and how it can enhance the software you build.

Learn about new runtimes and frameworks like Deno and Fresh that can take advantage of edge computing. See how easy it is to deploy to the edge and understand what it means to deploy your code as close as possible to your users and the benefits it brings.

The session will give you real-world examples and uses cases of edge computing so you can apply them to your work. We'll also cover the limitations of the edge and when it may not be the best fit for your project.

You will walk away from this session with the knowledge and skills to get the most out of edge computing.

<Collapsible title="Notes">
Edge Computing

- Location-based compute resources

Examples:

- Netlify Edge
- Cloudflare Worker

Edge → Serverless function that’s run close to where’s your user (consumer) calls it

- Runtime → the runtime version of the function that’s running
- WinterCG
- https://github.com/vercel/edge-runtime

Edge computing to answer the issue with data grows exponentially, to distribute the load of transferring data between different locations of the consumer (users)

Practical Uses for edge computing

Platform the speaker mentioned in regards to DB for edge compute

- Planetscale
- Deno KV

Another platform the speaker mentioned to build an API only on edge compute runtime

- Deno vs Deno Deploy
- Plain lambda function on AWS

## 3. Deep Dive into Push-based Front-end Architectures

**Speaker**: Aliaksei Kuncevic -  Director and Google Developer Expert - Angular Consulting

### Summary
Push-based front-end is a modern approach to web development that is gaining traction in the industry. Unlike traditional front-end development where the browser makes requests to the server for data, push-based front-end enables the server to proactively push data to the browser as it becomes available.

This approach provides several benefits including faster data delivery, reduced network traffic, and improved user experience.

In this talk, Aliaksei will walk you through push-based systems and how to approach that using modern front-end frameworks and libraries.

### Notes

I have a high expectation for this talk to learn something about this architecture, but it turns out the whole material
is a bit dry and when it gets into the topic that is interesting enough, the speaker didn't deep dive into the topic. So,
unfortunately, I didn't learn much from this talk.

## 4. CSS Container Queries: Reshaping the Way We Approach Responsive Web Design

**Speaker**: Trung Vo - Staff Software Engineer - Ascenda

### Summary
The rise of component-based architecture has brought new challenges to web developers, including the need for more granular control over layouts within individual components. While media queries have been a cornerstone of responsive web design for over a decade, they fall short when it comes to solving layout issues at the component level. Enter CSS container queries, a new tool that allows developers to style components based on their available space within a containing element. With container queries, we can use the same component everywhere, but it's restyling itself to fit best within the UI where it lives.

In this talk, we will explore the capabilities of container queries and how they can be used to achieve complex layouts without the need for heavy scripting or ResizeObserver hacks. We will cover the different container types, including inline size and size, and showcase real-world examples of container queries in action with Flexbox and grid.

Before container queries are available, the existing solution is to use the media queries to determine the different layouts for different viewports


[Container queries](https://web.dev/cq-stable/)
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_container_queries
- Restyle the layout of the component relative to the parent component sizing

Media queries can also be used with a range of syntax 

```css
@media (900 <= width <= 1800px)
```

Container query

Define it with the below syntax

- Container-type
- Container-name
- Container

And query it with the `@container` query.

## 5. But what about normal flow?

**Speaker**: Erin Zimmer - Software Engineer - Cash App

### Summary
When people talk about CSS layouts these days, it’s all about flex and grid. And, don’t get me wrong, flex and grid are pretty cool. But normal flow is still the default layout on the web, so that's what most of your app is probably using.

And given that normal flow is so fundamental, it's important to have a good understanding of how it works. But how it works can be a little counterintuitive. Why, for instance, can we easily centre a thing horizontally, but not vertically?

Let's have a look at the mental model behind normal flow, what kind of things it's good for, and when some of the newer, shinier features might be a better choice.

[Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow) 

What normal flow is for
- Is used for laying out documents
- Elements that hold other elements
    - `<article>, <p>, <fieldset>`
- Element that is content
- Block Element
    - Sized absolutely
    - `<article>, <details>, <p>, <fieldset>`

`margin-inline-start` automatically adds a margin that works both on LTR and RTL language

- Block element create inline boxes but doesn’t live in it

- Inline elements
    - You can’t specify width on inline elements - css use `display: inline-element`
    - `<abbr>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`

## 6. Static Analysis: Shockingly Useful! ⚡️

**Speaker**: Josh Goldberg - Open Source Developer

### Summary

Wouldn’t you love to automatically zap code bugs before releasing them to production? How about before your code even gets run? Static analysis tools scrutinize your code as you write it - giving you blazing-fast feedback at development time. We’re going to go into how that works, why it’s useful, and -best of all how to enable the best configurations for ESLint, TypeScript, and their associated tooling in your app.

We'll cover the tooling differences between formatters, linters, and type checkers, along with how to appropriately set up each of those tools for local development and CI/builds. We'll briefly skirt around the deep configuration rabbit holes one can joyously fall into when setting up ESLint plugins, then find ourselves using ESLint and TypeScript as documentation sources and educating developers on general and team-specific best practices. This talk will have you detecting bugs, bad practices, and code smells at lightning speed! ⚡️

<Collapsible title="Notes">
This is more of an intro talk on the need of applying the tools to improve the quality and standard within the code than anything else.

I like the fact that Josh delivers the talk in an attractive and energizing but there are not many new things that I learn from this talk.

Static Analysis

- Tooling that scrutinises your code without moving it vs. dynamic analysis - Test
    
Spectrum in the static analysis

Formatter - Linter - Types

The speaker discusses the detail of each of the spectrum above

Typescript is four things

- Language Service
    - Program that runs in your editor that checks for types
- Compiler
- Type Checker
    - Program that reads in files and reports likely bugs/mismatch
- Programming Language
