This is very exciting to me; I just move into new blog host and new blog as well. Iâ€™ve been on and off for blogging for the last couple of years. But this year, along with my decision to take a master degree, I want to start a new fresh chapter of my blog. First of all, Iâ€™m going to move from Jakarta, Indonesia to Melbourne, Australia to continue my education. I take Master of Information Technology at the University of Melbourne. Itâ€™s a very exciting experience for me, moving to a new country, meet new people, experience the new culture. Iâ€™m looking forward to it.

Another exciting thing is this new blog is built using static website generator, [hexo.io](https://hexo.io). I'm pretty exciting, when the first time, I read the documentation and since it's built on top of NodeJS, so I expect better performance than my old dumb wordpress.

Just like my last blog, with my new blog I hope I can share my experience with programming and some technical stuff. Sometimes maybe Iâ€™ll also post something related to my master degree and some about a new city that I will be staying for the next two years.

So this year is gonna be an exciting year. ðŸ™‚
